Bindings for the Maxim MAX31790 Fan Controller
==========================================================

Reference:

https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31790.pdf

The MAX31790 controls the speeds of up to six fans
using six independent PWM outputs. The desired fan
speeds (or PWM duty cycles) are written through the I2C
interface.

Required properties:
- compatible     : Must be "maxim,max31790"
- reg            : I2C slave address
- pwm-to-tach    : An array of six integers respond to six pwm channels for
                   configuring the pwm to tach mode.

                   When set to 0, the associated PWMOUT produces a PWM waveform 
                   for control of fan speed. When set to 1, PWMOUT becomes a TACH input

                   Without the "pwm-to-tach" properties, by default "pwm-to-tach" is <0 0 0 0 0 0>

Example: Set PWM channel 5-6 become TACH input mode

        fans@20 {
                compatible = "maxim,max31790";
                reg = <0x20>;
                pwm-to-tach = <0 0 0 0 1 1>;
        };
